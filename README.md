## Come Build With Me at Network School

Network School is a 12-month residential program for builders in Kuala Lumpur. $1,500/mo — housing, co-working, and a community of people actually shipping things.

**I'm making it cheaper for whoever uses my referral:**
- 1 week free at signup (~$375 off)
- **+$500 Venmo from me personally when you arrive**
- Effective first month: **~$625** (less than half price)
