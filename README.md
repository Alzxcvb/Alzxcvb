## Come Build With Me at Network School

Network School is a residential program for builders across the bay from Singapore. The $1,500/mo fee covers everything — housing, 3 full meals designed by Brian Johnson, co-working space, daily workshops from many experts, a simcard, and a community of people actually shipping things living ina tropical vacation hotel 🤣.

**I'm making it cheaper for whoever uses my referral:**
- 1 week free at signup when you use ANY referral link
- **+$500 Venmo from me personally when you use mine!**
- Effective first month: **~$625** (less than half price)

## If you're impressed with what I'm doing know that you can too!

I was a Federal Employee living in Los Angeles, California this time last year and over the course of 2 weeks I got up to speed with all things AI and learned the tools available in the market today. Started shipping code daily (check my commits!) and learning at a speed I haven't done since the days of the 😷 (at School)
